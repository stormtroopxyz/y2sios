"""Make a camera's colour tuning, as libredwood-media's processor reads it (userland/src/camera_isp.c,
isp_load_tuning), out of the camera's tuning file of Android's camera stack
(/vendor/lib64/camera/com.qti.tuned.<name>.bin of the phone: the vendor's, kept in fw-camera/ and never in
the repository; so is what this makes of it).

usage: camtuning.py TUNED.bin OUT.isp     (camtuning.py TUNED.bin -   lists what is there only)

The tuning file is a "QTI Chromatix Header" / "Parameter Parser V3.0.1" file, laid out as the sensors'
module files are (see camsensor.py): a table of symbols { id, name[32], kind, ?, parent, offset, size }
and the data they point into. Two of its modules are taken, each as Chromatix keeps it -- a tree whose
first level is the flash (led_idx_data: 0 without one, the only one taken), the next the scene's light
(aec_data: from a lux index to another, Qualcomm's measure of how dark the scene is: higher is darker),
the last the light's colour temperature (cct_data: from a CCT to another, in kelvin):

  cc13 (the colour matrix, IPE's): per light and temperature a 3x3 matrix from the sensor's colours,
       white balanced, to linear sRGB, by rows R, G, B (each row sums to 1)
  lsc34 (lens shading): per light and temperature a gain for each of R, Gr, Gb and B at each point of
       a 17 x 13 grid laid over the sensor (corners on its corners, rows from the top)

and, of its white balance (Qualcomm's AWB), the reference lights (refPtV1): ten of them for every camera
of this phone, each as the sensor sees a grey under it, red over green and blue over green -- from the
bluest daylight to a candle, in the order 10000 K, D75, D65, D50 (whose gains are the AWB's first ones,
initDataV1), cool white and TL84 fluorescent tubes, U30, A (a filament lamp), horizon, candle. Each is
given the colour temperature that the tables above are picked by for it: its own, but 3800 K for U30, a
3000 K light without the infrared a filament gives -- as a white LED is -- whose tables are TL84's (the
wide camera under a warm white LED: its colour shading measured on a white sheet is TL84's table's to
within 3 %, the 2550-2900 K one's is 12 % off in red).

OUT.isp: "RWCISP02"; the number of the matrices' light ranges and per range { lux index from, to (two
floats), the number of temperature ranges, per range { CCT from, to, the matrix (9 floats) } }; the
same for the lens shading, with per temperature range { CCT from, to, R, Gr, Gb, B grids (17 x 13 floats
each) }; the number of reference lights (0 where there are not the ten) and each { R/G, B/G, CCT }.
Everything little-endian, counts as 32-bit words.
